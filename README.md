# Hawaii Election Shapefile
This shapefile comes from Hawaii Statewide GIS Program and was processed by Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) staff.

## Sources
This precinct shapefile comes from the [Hawaii Statewide GIS Program](http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/) in the State Office of Planning. Election results come from the [State of Hawaii Office of Elections](https://elections.hawaii.gov/election-results/). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile for Hawaii was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).

## Preprocessing
Precincts 41-02 and 41-05 were merged as were precincts 42-01 and 42-04 in order to join 2016 and 2018 results onto the same precinct boundaries. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using [MGGG’s proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup).
